## Data Analyst | OPCA

I am a Data Analyst based in Oregon, currently driving strategic objectives for the **Oregon Primary Care Association (OPCA)**. My work focuses on leveraging analytics software—including Arcadia, Tableau, and SQL—to provide actionable intelligence that supports community health centers across the state.

My background sits at the intersection of technical engineering and business strategy. Before pivoting to data analytics, I spent several years as a **Technical Support Engineer at Salesforce**, where I specialized in troubleshooting complex custom code and integrations for commercial and government clients.

I hold an **MBA** from Quantic School of Business and Technology and a **B.S. in Computer Science** from Eastern Oregon University.

## Current Focus
I am currently managing the ingestion and analysis of Electronic Health Record (EHR) and CCLF claims data within the **Arcadia Data Analytics Platform** to uncover actionable healthcare patterns.

Simultaneously, I am expanding my technical toolkit—with a focus on R programming, probabilistic modeling, and advanced visualization—in pursuit of the **University of Michigan Master of Applied Data Science (MADS)** program.
