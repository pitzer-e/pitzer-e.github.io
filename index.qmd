## Data Analyst | Oregon Primary Care Association

I am a Data Analyst based in Medford, Oregon, specializing in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights for non-profit healthcare. 

With a background as a Salesforce Support Engineer and an MBA, I bridge the gap between technical data architecture and strategic business goals. My work focuses on visualizing community health data to support primary care initiatives across Oregon.

This site serves as a digital garden for my projects in Python, SQL, Tableau, and R.
