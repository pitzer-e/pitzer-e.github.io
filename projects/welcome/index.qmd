## About This Portfolio

This site showcases my approach to **code-first analytics engineering**—building automated, reproducible data products that replace manual reporting workflows with self-healing pipelines.

### What You'll Find Here

**[Case Studies](../../projects.html)** — Technical deep dives featuring:
- Python-based ETL pipeline architectures
- CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions
- Infrastructure-as-code implementations
- Data validation and quality frameworks

**[Dashboards](../../dashboards.html)** — Business intelligence solutions including:
- Interactive Tableau visualizations
- Healthcare analytics dashboards
- Operational reporting tools

### My Development Philosophy

I embrace **AI-augmented programming** as a way to enhance, not replace, human expertise. AI assistants provide real-time feedback, accelerate iteration cycles, and enable active learning through concept review and self-testing.

**But responsible use requires:**
- **Human oversight** — Understanding and verifying all deployed code
- **Transparency** — Being clear about AI tool usage
- **Continuous learning** — Using AI to deepen technical understanding, not bypass it

The goal is augmented intelligence: combining human judgment and domain expertise with AI's ability to generate solutions and explain complex concepts.
