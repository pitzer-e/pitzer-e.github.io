## Overview

This project represents a strategic shift from manual, GUI-based reporting (Tableau) to Code-First Analytics Engineering. 

The goal was to build a self-healing, automated data product that tracks Health Center Service Delivery Sites in Oregon without requiring manual intervention.

## Advanced Analytics & QA

**Data Enrichment**: Successfully ingested 2024 UDS Grantee Data via direct FOIA endpoint, implementing a robust pandas cleaning layer to handle mixed numeric/text columns in government Excel files.

**Relational Joining**: Engineered a deterministic join between HRSA geospatial data and UDS patient demographics using BHCMISID keys, achieving a 97% match rate (318/328 sites).

**Automated Quality Assurance**: Integrated pytest into the CI/CD pipeline. The system now enforces data integrity checks (e.g., Uninsured < Total Patients, Lat/Lon within Oregon bounds) before every deployment, preventing "silent failures" in production.

## The Pipeline

The system is architected as a serverless ETL pipeline running on **GitHub Actions**.
