## Overview

This project represents a strategic shift from manual, GUI-based reporting (Tableau) to **Code-First Analytics Engineering**. 

The goal was to build a self-healing, automated data product that tracks Health Center Service Delivery Sites in Oregon without requiring manual intervention.

## The Pipeline

The system is architected as a serverless ETL pipeline running on **GitHub Actions**.
